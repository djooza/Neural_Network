# Neural_Network

In this repository, I have uploaded an ipynb file of a project I did while on an exchange program in Lleida, Spain. In this project, my friend and I had to find a large image dataset and train the neural network to know if the image is of a dog or a cat. In order to pass the class, the accuracy had to be at least 80%, we got this one to 91% and haven't improved it anymore.
